#How this works:
1. Install docx2pdf, pypiwin32, PyPDF2 beforehand 
(type in CMD and press enter: py -m pip install [insert package name here])
2. Put the code in the same directory with all files need to combine  (can be doc, docx, pdf format)
3. Put a blank pdf file starting with '000_blank' in the same directory (for adding blank pages for odd number pages)
4. Rename the files you want to combine with the order you want them in (e.g. '1_intro', '2_map', etc)
5. Run the code and profit \o/

#What it does:
1. turn doc to docx
2. docx to pdf
3. combine all pdf, add a blank page if pdf has odd number pages for easy printing
4. rotate all landscape pages to portrait
